    <!--Description of Code-->
    <p>
      Programming a calculator is mainly a simple task, a basic one primarily consists of<br>
      taking two number variables and performing an operation on them. However,<br>
      A quirk of math means you have to take into consideration an extra step when making one<br>
      That consideration is dividing by 0. If you do not account for this you can cause your calculator<br>
      to break in unforeseen ways.

      <div><br>Here is an example of some code written with an exception for divide by 0.</div>
      <pre>
        <code>
        if (<kbd>operator</kbd> == '/'){
          if (<var>num2</var> == 0){
            System.out.println("Error, can't divide by 0.");
          } else
          <samp>result</samp> = <var>num1</var> / <var>num2</var>;
        }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <br>Professor Greatest Programmer has famously said:<q>It is <strong>vital</strong> to make an exception for divide by 0 to avoid logical errors.</q>
